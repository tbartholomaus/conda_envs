# Conda environment files

These are the environment files used to create specialized conda environments for use with python. 

These environments are available to all users on `kennicott`, and are also on Tim's personal computer.  Anyone can download these environments to their personal computers as well, to create identical environments for computing while not connected to `kennicott`.
