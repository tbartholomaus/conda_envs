# Conda environment files

These are the environment files used to create specialized conda environments for use with python in the University of Idaho Glacier Dynamics lab. 

These environments are available to all users on the lab server, `kennicott`, and are also on Tim's personal computer.  Anyone can download these environments to their personal computers as well, to create identical environments for computing while not connected to `kennicott`.

By building each environment from scratch, through these environment.yml files, environments appear easier to maintain up-to-date and conflict free than if new modules are added incrementally with occasional `conda install` commands. Read more about managing conda environments [here, at the conda website](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file), to create new environments on your local computer from these `.yml` files.  On a PC computer running Windows, management of these environments happens through the "Anaconda prompt."
